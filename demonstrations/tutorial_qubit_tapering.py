The performance of variational quantum algorithms is considerably limited by the number of qubits
required to prepare the trial wave function ansatz. In the context of quantum chemistry, this
limitation hinders the treatment of large molecules with algorithms such as the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). Several approaches have been developed to reduce the qubit requirements for
electronic structure calculations. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the symmetry-based qubit
tapering approach which allows reducing the number of qubits required to perform molecular quantum
simulations based on the :math:`\mathbb{Z}_2` symmetries present in molecular Hamiltonians
[#bravyi2017]_ [#setia2019]_.

A molecular Hamiltonian in the qubit basis is constructed as a linear combination of Pauli words
as

.. math:: H = \sum_{i=1}^r c_i \eta_i

where :math:`c_i` is a real coefficient and :math:`\eta_i` is a tensor product of Pauli and
Identity operators acting on M qubits

.. math:: \eta_i \in \pm \left \{ I, \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \right \} ^ {\bigotimes M}.

The main idea in the symmetry-based qubit tapering approach is to find a unitary operator :math:`U`
that transforms :math:`H` to a new Hamiltonian :math:`H'` which has the same eigenvalues as
:math:`H`

.. math:: H' = U^{\dagger} H U = \sum_{i=1}^r c_i \mu_i,

such that each :math:`\mu_i` term in the new Hamiltonian acts trivially, e.g., with an Identity
operator, on a set of qubits. This allows tapering-off those qubits from the Hamiltonian. We can
also construct the unitary :math:`U` such that each :math:`\mu_i` term acts with a Pauli-X operator
on a set of qubits :math:`\left \{ q_j \right \}, j \in \left \{ l, ..., k \right \}`. This
guarantees that each term of the transformed Hamiltonian commutes with the Pauli-X operator applied
to :math:`j`-th qubit and

.. math:: [H', \sigma_x^{q_j}] = 0.

Recall that two commuting operators share an eigenbasis. This means that the eigenfunction of the
transformed Hamiltonian :math:`H'` is also an eigenfunction of each of the :math:`\sigma_x^{q_j}`
operators. As a result, we can factor out the :math:`\sigma_x^{q_j}`
operators from the transformed Hamiltonian and replace them with their eigenvalues which are
:math:`\pm 1`. This gives us a tapered Hamiltonian in which the set of
:math:`\left \{ q_j \right \}, j \in \left \{ l, ..., k \right \}` qubits are eliminated.

The unitary operator :math:`U` can be constructed as a Clifford operator [#bravyi2017]_

.. math:: U = \Pi_j \left [\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left (\sigma_x^{q(j)} + \tau_j \right) \right],

where :math:`\tau` denotes the generators of the symmetry group of :math:`H` and
:math:`\sigma_x^{q}` operators which act on those qubits that will be ultimately tapered off from
the Hamiltonian.

The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is defined as an abelian group of pauli words that commute
with each term in the Hamiltonian (excluding :math:`âˆ’I`). The
`generators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group>`__ of the symmetry group are
those elements of the group that can be linearly combined, along with their inverses, to create any
other member of the group. The symmetry group and the generators of the Hamiltonian can be obtained
from the binary matrix representation of the Hamiltonian [#bravyi2017]_ with the functions of the
PennyLane :py:mod:`~.pennylane.hf.tapering` module.

Let's use the qubit tapering method and obtain the ground state energy of the `Helium hydride
cation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_hydride_ion>`__ :math:`\textrm{HeH}^+`.

Tapering the molecular Hamiltonian
----------------------------------

In PennyLane, a molecular Hamiltonian can be created by specifying the atomic symbols and
coordinates and then creating a molecule object that stores all the molecular parameters needed to
construct the Hamiltonian.

#
# We can now obtain the symmetry generators and the :math:`\sigma_x^{q_j}` operators that are

# The generators and the Pauli-X operators are used to construct the unitary :math:`U` operator that

# Pauli-X operator. For each of these qubits, we can simply replace the Pauli-X operator with one
# of its eigenvalues :math:`+1` or :math:`-1`. This results in a total number of :math:`2^n`
# Hamiltonians each corresponding to one eigenvalue sector. The optimal sector corresponding to the

# Conclusions
# -----------
# Molecular Hamiltonians posses symmetries that can be leveraged to taper off qubits in quantum
# computing simulations. This tutorial introduces the PennyLane functionality that can be used for
# qubit tapering based on :math:`\mathbb{Z}_2` symmetries. The procedure of obtaining the tapered
# Hamiltonian and the tapered reference state is straightforward, however, building the wavefunction
# ansatz needs some experience. The qubit coupled cluster method might be used as an appropriate
# model for building the variational ansatz.
