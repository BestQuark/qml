The performance of variational quantum algorithms is considerably limited by the number of qubits
required to represent wave functions. In the context of quantum chemistry, this
limitation hinders the treatment of large molecules with algorithms such as the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). Several approaches have been developed to reduce the qubit requirements for
quantum chemistry calculations. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the symmetry-based qubit
tapering approach which allows reducing the number of qubits required to perform molecular quantum
simulations based on the :math:`\mathbb{Z}_2` symmetries present in molecular Hamiltonians
[#bravyi2017]_ [#setia2019]_.

A molecular Hamiltonian in the qubit basis can be expressed as a linear combination of Pauli words
as

.. math:: H = \sum_{i=1}^r h_i P_i

where :math:`h_i` is a real coefficient and :math:`P_i` is a tensor product of Pauli and
Identity operators acting on M qubits

.. math:: P_i \in \pm \left \{ I, X, Y, Z \right \} ^ {\bigotimes M}.

The main idea in the symmetry-based qubit tapering approach is to find a unitary operator :math:`U`
that transforms :math:`H` to a new Hamiltonian :math:`H'` which has the same eigenvalues as
:math:`H`

.. math:: H' = U^{\dagger} H U = \sum_{i=1}^r c_i \mu_i,

such that each :math:`\mu_i` term in the new Hamiltonian acts trivially, e.g., with an Identity
operator or a Pauli operator at most, on a set of qubits. This allows tapering-off those qubits from
the Hamiltonian. For instance, consider the following Hamiltonian

.. math:: H = Z_0 X_1 - X_1 + Y_0 X_1,

where all terms in the Hamiltonian act on the second qubit with the :math:`X` operator. It is
straightforward to show that each term in the Hamiltonian commutes with :math:`I_0 X_1` and the
ground state eigenvector of :math:`H` is also an eigenvector of :math:`I_0 X_1` with eigenvalues
:math:`\pm 1`. We can also rewrite the Hamiltonian as

.. math:: H = (Z_0 I_1 - I_0 I_1 + Y_0 I_1) I_0 X_1

which gives us

.. math:: H|\psi \rangle = \pm1 (Z_0 I_1 - I_0 I_1 + Y_0 I_1)|\psi \rangle.

This means that the Hamiltonian :math:`H` is equivalent to :math:`\pm1(Z_0 I_1 - I_0 I_1 + Y_0 I_1)`
which can be simplified as

.. math:: H_{tapered} = \pm1 (Z_0 - I_0 + Y_0).

More generaly, we can construct the unitary :math:`U` such that each :math:`\mu_i` term acts with a
Pauli-X operator on a set of qubits
:math:`\left \{ q_j \right \}, j \in \left \{ l, ..., k \right \}`. This guarantees that each term
of the transformed Hamiltonian commutes with each of the the Pauli-X operator applied to the
:math:`j`-th qubit:

.. math:: [H', X^{q_j}] = 0,

and the eigenvectors of the transformed Hamiltonian :math:`H'` are also eigenvectors of each of the
:math:`X^{q_j}` operators. Then we can factor out all of the the :math:`X^{q_j}` operators from the
transformed Hamiltonian and replace them with their eigenvalues :math:`\pm 1`. This gives us a
set of tapered Hamiltonians, depending on which eigenvalue :math:`\pm 1` we chose for each
:math:`X^{q_j}` operator, in which the set of :math:`\left \{ q_j \right \}, j \in \left \{ l, ..., k \right \}`
qubits are eliminated. For instance, in the case of two tapered qubites, we have four eigenvalue
sector: :math:`[+1, +1]`, :math:`[-1, +1]`, :math:`[+1, -1]`, :math:`[-1, -1].


The unitary operator :math:`U` can be constructed as a
`Clifford <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_gates>`__ operator [#bravyi2017]_

.. math:: U = \Pi_j \left [\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left (X^{q(j)} + \tau_j \right) \right],

where :math:`\tau` denotes the generators of the symmetry group of :math:`H` and
:math:`X^{q}` operators which act on those qubits that will be ultimately tapered off from
the Hamiltonian.

The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is defined as an Abelian group of Pauli words that commute
with each term in the Hamiltonian (excluding :math:`âˆ’I`). The
`generators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group>`__ of the symmetry group are
those elements of the group that can be combined, along with their inverses, to create any other
member of the group. The generators of the  symmetry group of the Hamiltonian can be obtained with
the :func:`~.pennylane.hf.generate_symmetries` function in PennyLane.

Let's use the qubit tapering method and obtain the ground state energy of the `Helium hydride
cation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_hydride_ion>`__ :math:`\textrm{HeH}^+`.

Tapering the molecular Hamiltonian
----------------------------------

In PennyLane, a molecular Hamiltonian can be created by specifying the atomic symbols and
coordinates and then creating a molecule object that stores all the molecular parameters needed to
construct the Hamiltonian.

# results in a total number of :math:`2^k` Hamiltonians, where :math:`k` is the number of

# tapered Hamiltonian. It can be done with the :func:`~.pennylane.hf.transform_hf`.

# Conclusions
# -----------
# Molecular Hamiltonians posses symmetries that can be leveraged to the number of qubits required
# in quantum computing simulations. This tutorial introduces the PennyLane functionality that can
# be used for qubit tapering based on :math:`\mathbb{Z}_2` symmetries. The procedure includes
# obtaining tapered Hamiltonians and tapered reference states that can be used in variational
# quantum algorithms such as VQE.
